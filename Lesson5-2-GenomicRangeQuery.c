/*Find the minimal nucleotide from a range of sequence DNA
A DNA sequence can be represented as a string consisting of
the letters A, C, G and T, which correspond to the types of
successive nucleotides in the sequence. Each nucleotide has
an impact factor, which is an integer. Nucleotides of types
A, C, G and T have impact factors of 1, 2, 3 and 4, 
respectively. You are going to answer several queries of 
the form: What is the minimal impact factor of nucleotides
contained in a particular part of the given DNA sequence?

The DNA sequence is given as a non-empty string 
S = S[0]S[1]...S[N-1] consisting of N characters. 
There are M queries, which are given in non-empty arrays
 P and Q, each consisting of M integers. The K-th query 
 (0 â‰¤ K < M) requires you to find the minimal impact factor
  of nucleotides contained in the DNA sequence between positions P[K] and Q[K] (inclusive).
